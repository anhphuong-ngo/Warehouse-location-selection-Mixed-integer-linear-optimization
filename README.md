# Warehouse-location-selection-Mixed-integer-linear-optimization
Warehouse location selection Mixed-integer linear optimization (MILP). The model is coded on Python CVXPY and uses GLPK solver.

The goal of this optimization model is to establish a production and distribution plan for a major North American manufacturing company. Given they have 3 manufacturing plants producing 6 different products, 15 distribution center candidates, and 15 demand zones. The goal was to determine how many warehouses they should open, and which warehouses should ship which products to which demand zones to minimize the companyâ€™s cost of operations.
